  The rock gardens of Al Sborf
---

Hardly anywhere else is it more impressive to see how scarce the habitat 
was in the Calanca Valley 300 years ago and more. 

The area with the restored walls documents grain cultivation at the limits 
of what was possible and the desperate endeavours of earlier generations 
to somehow secure their food. 

The walls, made of rough stones, lean irregularly against large boulders, 
whose heat reflection and wind protection effect is fully utilised. 
On the small areas behind the walls and on large rocks, there is only a thin, 
painstakingly scraped-together layer of soil.

A stone desert made its small contribution to survival!
