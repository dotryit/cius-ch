  The Ciüs terrace complex
---

We are standing here in front of „Ciüs“, which is surrounded by 
protective walls. It covers around 10 acres.

The amount of work involved in the creation was enormous. Per square metre
of cultivated area on average 1.2 tonnes of stone had to be built into walls, 
and this was done exclusively with human labour.

Cereal cultivation in the narrow mountain valley is only promising if 
the microclimatic conditions are favourable. Within the boundaries of 
the municipality of Cauco, we find particularly ideal conditions in this 
respect under the rock face above Lasciallo.
