  The importance of agriculture in the Calanca Valley
---

Until the middle of the 19th century, grain cultivation 
was of great importance in the Calanca Valley. As there were no 
passable roads in the valley, food was based almost entirely on 
self-sufficiency. A family needed at least 10 to 15 acres of grain 
cultivation if they wanted to have 2 to 3 kilograms of 
their own bread per week.

The necessary land could only be obtained by terracing steep slopes. 
A huge amount of effort was put into preparing small fields and 
modest harvests were wrested from the stony soil.

The terracing prevents erosion of the soil. The rock face and 
terrace walls store heat during the day, which they release 
after sunset. This delays cooling at night.
